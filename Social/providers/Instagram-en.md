# Instagram

Application access to Instagram's login service is currently possible using the
[Instagram Platform API](https://www.instagram.com/developer/). Facebook has
announced that this API has been deprecated and it is scheduled to be
discontinued in early 2020.

The Instagram Platform API is being replaced by the [Instagram Graph
API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api). At present, this new
API only supports access to Instagram business accounts via [Facebook
Login](Facebook-en.md).

According to a 2018 [blog
post](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/01/30/instagram-graph-api-updates/):

>"Basic permissioning for non-business profiles will be supported in early 2019"

However this does not yet appear to be available and there is not yet any
indication that this planned API will allow third-party web applications to
support end-user login with an Instagram account.

In light of this uncertainty, the use of Instagram for logging in to Government
of Canada applications is NOT RECCOMENDED at this time.
