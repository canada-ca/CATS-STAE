# The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framwork

 OAuth 2.0 is an industry-standard protocol for authorization. OAuth 2.0
 supersedes the work done on the original [OAuth 1.0](OAuth1-en.md) protocol
 created in 2006. OAuth 2.0 focuses on client developer simplicity while
 providing specific authorization flows for web applications, desktop
 applications, mobile phones, and living room devices.
