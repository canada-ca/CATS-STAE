# OAuth 1.0

Version 1.0 of the OAuth protocol was originally created by a small community of
web developers from a variety of websites and other Internet services who
wanted to solve the common problem of enabling delegated access to protected
resources.  The resulting OAuth protocol was stabilized at version 1.0 in
October 2007, and revised in June 2009 (Revision A) as published at
<http://oauth.net/core/1.0a>.

The OAuth 1.0 protocol is now considered obsolete, however it is still used by
some social media services such as Twitter.
