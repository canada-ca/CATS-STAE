=== CATS-Specific Requirements

==== Request Signing

*[CIP-SP01]*

`<samlp:AuthnRequest>` messages MUST be signed using the SHA-256 algorithm.

*[CIP-SP02]*

`<samlp:AuthnRequest>` messages SHOULD NOT include an `isPassive` attribute. If
the SP implementation is unable to omit the `isPassive` attribute then it MUST
have a value of  `false` or `0`.

_In all cases of identity authentication, the IdP must interact with the
end-user in order to obtain their informed consent._
