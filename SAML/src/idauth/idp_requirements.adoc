=== CATS-Specific Requirements

==== Metadata Content

*[CDP-IDP01]*

In addition to the requirements of *[SDP-IDP31]*, an IdPâ€™s metadata MUST also
contain the levels of assurance to which it conforms, as specified by the
Identity Assurance Certification Attribute Profile <<SAML2Assur>>.

==== Responses

*[CIP-IDP01]*

IdP deployments MUST support the issuance of `<saml2p:Response>` messages (with
appropriate status codes) in the event that a user indicates they wish to
cancel/exit or if an error condition occurs, provided that the user agent
remains available.

==== Security

*[CIP-IDP02]*

The private keys of an IdPs signing certificates MUST be protected within the
boundary of a FIPS 140-2 Level 2 or higher validated hardware cryptographic
module.


==== Attributes

*[CIP-IDP03]*

IdP deployments SHOULD prioritize the use of standard attribute
name and definition profiles before defining custom attributes. Use of the
following profiles are RECCOMENDED in descending order of preference:

* The standard OpenID Connect claims defined in section 5.1 of <<OIDC>>. (See
  [CIP-IDP05] below). 
* The Identity Metasystem Interoperability claim types
  defined in section 7.5 of <<IMI>>.
* The SAML V2.0 X.500/LDAP Attribute Profile <<X500SAMLattr>>.

*[CIP-IDP04]*

<saml:Attribute> elements MUST use a `NameFormat` value of either
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:basic` or
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri`.

*[CIP-IDP05]*

The name and value of  `<saml:Attribute>` elements with a `NameFormat` of
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:basic` MUST correspond to one of
the standard claims defined in section 5.1 of <<OIDC>> as follows:

* The value of the `Name` attribute of `<saml:Attribute>` must match the JSON member name in <<OIDC>>.
* The `xsi:type` attribute of `<saml:AttributeValue>` must correspond to the JSON type in <<OIDC>>.
* The `address` claim MUST NOT be used. _Refer to requirement [SDP-IDP18]_.
* The following component members of the `address` claim MAY be used:
** street_address
** locality
** region
** postal_code
** country
* The `formatted` member of the `address` claim SHOULD NOT be used.
