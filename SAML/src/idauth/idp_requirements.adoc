=== CATS-Specific Requirements

==== Metadata Content

*[CDP-IDP01]*

In addition to the requirements of *[SDP-IDP31]*, an IdPâ€™s metadata MUST also
contain the levels of assurance to which it conforms, as specified by the
Identity Assurance Certification Attribute Profile <<SAML2Assur>>.

==== Responses

*[CIP-IDP01]*

IdP deployments MUST support the issuance of `<saml2p:Response>` messages (with
appropriate status codes) in the event that a user indicates they wish to
cancel/exit or if an error condition occurs, provided that the user agent
remains available.

==== Security

*[CIP-IDP02]*

The private keys of an IdPs signing certificates MUST be protected within the
boundary of a FIPS 140-2 Level 2 or higher validated hardware cryptographic
module.
