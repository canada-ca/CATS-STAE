== Introduction

SAML V2.0 is a rich and extensible standard that must be profiled to be used
interoperably, and the profiles that typically emerge from the broader
standardization process usually remain fairly broad and include a number of
options and features that increase the burden for implementers and make
deployment-time decisions more difficult.

Implementation profiles define the features that software implementations must
support such that deployers can be assured of the ability to meet their own
(possibly varied) deployment requirements. Deployment profiles define specific
options and constraints to which deployments are required to conform; they guide
product configuration and federation operations, and provide criteria against
which actual deployments may be tested. This document provides a
deployment profile for use by members of the Sign in Canada federation.


=== Overview of the CATS SAML 2.0 Deployment Profile for Identity Authentication

This deployment profile is based on the draft SAML V2.0 Interoperability
Deployment Profile V1.0 <<SAML2Iop>> published by the Kantara Initiative, which
in turn is based on the SAML 2.0 specifications created by the Security Services
Technical Committee (SSTC) of the Organization for the Advancement of Structured
Information Standards (OASIS).

The scope of this profile applies only to providers and consumers of trusted
identity authentication services. A seperate profile suppors anonymous
credential authentication services.
