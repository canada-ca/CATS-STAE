=== CATS-Specific Requirements

==== Authentication Request Signing

*[CIP-SP01]*

`<samlp:AuthnRequest>` messages MUST be signed using the SHA-256 algorithm.

*[CIP-SP02]*

`<samlp:AuthnRequest>` messages SHOULD NOT include an `isPassive` attribute. If
the SP implementation is unable to omit the `isPassive` attribute then it MUST
have a value of  `false` or `0`.

_In all cases of identity authentication, the IdP must interact with the
end-user in order to obtain their informed consent._

==== Metadata and Trust Management

*[CIP-SP03]*

The `<md:SPSSODescriptor>` element of SP metadata MUST contain at least one
`<md:AttributeConsumingService>` element that specifies the attributes required
or desired by the relying party. `<md:AttributeConsumingService>` MUST include
two `<md:ServiceName>` elements, one in english and one in french.
`<md:ServiceDescription>`, if present, MUST also be included for both english
and french.
