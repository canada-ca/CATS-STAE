The metadata of SPs MUST contain at least one signing certificate with
the ``use`` attribute set to ``signing`` and at least one encryption certificate
with the ``use`` attribute set to ``encryption``.

SP metadata MAY include an `<md:Extensions>` element containing an
`<mdui:UIInfo>` extension element, but it MUST NOT include an
`<mdattr:EntityAttributes>` extension element.

The ``<md:SPSSODescriptor>`` element of an SP's metadata MUST also include an
``AuthnRequestsSigned`` attribute set to ``true`` or ``1`` and a
``WantAssertionsSigned`` attribute set to ``true`` or ``1``.
