SP deployments MUST support `<saml:NameID>` and the
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent` name identifier format as
described in <<SAML2Core>>. `<saml:Attribute>` elements MUST NOT be used for
this purpose.

_The  `NameQualifier` and `SPNameQualifier` attributes of the `<saml:NameID>`
element allow for the qualification of the element value, which  provides
critical functionality to support changes in the topology of a federation. This
profile has not adopted [SAML2SubjAttr] as it does not currently provide
equivalent functionality._
