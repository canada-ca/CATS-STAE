The metadata of SPs MUST contain at least one signing certificate with
the ``use`` attribute set to ``signing`` and at least one encryption certificate
with the ``use`` attribute set to ``encryption``.

SP metadata MAY include an `<md:Extensions>` element containing an
`<mdui:UIInfo>` extension element, but it MUST NOT include an
`<mdattr:EntityAttributes>` extension element.

The ``<md:SPSSODescriptor>`` element of an SP's metadata MUST also include an
``AuthnRequestsSigned`` attribute set to ``true`` or ``1`` and a
``WantAssertionsSigned`` attribute set to ``true`` or ``1``.

An SP's metadata SHOULD include two `<md:SingleLogoutService>` elements, one
with the `Binding` attribute value of
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect`, the other with the
`Binding` attribute value of `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:SOAP`.
