The SOAP binding <<SAML2Bind>> MUST be used for the transmission of
<samlp:LogoutRequest> messages to SPs that have included a
`<md:SingleLogoutService>` SOAP endpoint in their metadata.

The HTTP-Redirect binding <<SAML2Bind>> MUST be used for the transmission of
<samlp:LogoutRequest> messages to those SPs that have not included a
`<md:SingleLogoutService>` SOAP endpoint in their metadata, but have included an
HTTP-Redirect endpoint.

In cases where multiple SPs are participating in a session, identity providers
MUST first use the SOAP binding to send `<samlp:LogoutRequest>` messages to all
SPs that support SOAP before using the HTTP-Redirect binding to send
`<samlp:LogoutRequest>` messages to any SPs that do not support SOAP.

Notwithstanding the above, in cases where multiple session participants support
the same binding, an IdP MAY send `<samlp:LogoutRequest>` messages to multiple
SPs concurrently using the same binding.

_Doing so can improve the response time perceived by the user._

When using the HTTP-Redirect binding to transmit <samlp:LogoutRequest> messages,
an IdP SHOULD NOT employ mechanisms that could lead to loss of control of
the user agent in situations where an SP fails to respond to the
<samlp:LogoutRequest>.

_For example, if the IdP employs a full-frame browser redirect to an SP that
fails to respond, control of the browser will not return to the IdP and it will
not be able to respond to the SP that initiated the logout._
