== Introduction

SAML V2.0 is a rich and extensible standard that must be profiled to be used
interoperably, and the profiles that typically emerge from the broader
standardization process usually remain fairly broad and include a number of
options and features that increase the burden for implementers and make
deployment-time decisions more difficult.

Implementation profiles define the features that software implementations must
support such that deployers can be assured of the ability to meet their own
(possibly varied) deployment requirements. Deployment profiles define specific
options and constraints to which deployments are required to conform; they guide
product configuration and federation operations, and provide criteria against
which actual deployments may be tested. This document provides a
deployment profile for use by members of the Sign in Canada federation.

=== Overview of the CATS Deployment Profile for SAML 2.0

This deployment profile of SAML 2.0 supports four of the eight trusted
processes that make up the Verified Login Component of the Pan-Canadian Trust
Framework <<PCTF>>:

* *Authentication* establishes the confidence, or Level of Assurance, that a
Subject has control over their issued credential and that the credential is
currently valid (i.e., not suspended or revoked).
* *Authentication Session Initiation* enables a persistent interaction between a
Subject and an end-point, such as a CSP or RP, while removing the need to
continuously repeat the authentication process between interactions.
* *Authentication Session Termination* an explicit logout event, session
expiration due to inactivity or maximum duration, or other means.
* *Identity Verification* is the confirmation that the identity information being
presented relates to the person who is making the claim.

This deployment profile is based on the draft SAML V2.0 Interoperability
Deployment Profile V1.0 <<SAML2Iop>> published by the Kantara Initiative, which
in turn is based on the SAML 2.0 specifications created by the Security Services
Technical Committee (SSTC) of the Organization for the Advancement of Structured
Information Standards (OASIS).
