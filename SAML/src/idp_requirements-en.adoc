=== CATS-Specific Requirements

==== Metadata Content

*[CDP-IDP01]*

In addition to the requirements of *[SDP-IDP31]*, an IdPâ€™s metadata MUST also
contain the levels of assurance to which it conforms, as specified by the
Identity Assurance Certification Attribute Profile <<SAML2Assur>>.

==== Responses

*[CDP-IDP02]*

IdP deployments MUST support the issuance of `<saml2p:Response>` messages (with
appropriate status codes) in the event that a user indicates they wish to
cancel/exit or if an error condition occurs, provided that the user agent
remains available.

==== Session Management and Timeouts

*[CDP-IDP03]*

`<saml:AuthnStatement>` elements MUST NOT include a `SessionNotOnOrAfter`
attribute.

*[CDP-IDP04]*

IdPs MUST NOT issue a `<saml:Assertion>` with an `IssueInstant` attribute value
that exceeds the value of the `AuthnInstant` attribute of the included
`<saml:AuthnStatement>` by more than 20 minutes.

_This effectively prohibits the passive fulfilment of authentication requests
(single sign-on) for a subject after 20 minutes have passed since their
most recent authentication event._

Once 20 minutes have passed since the most recent authentication event,
IDPs MUST issue a `<saml:Repsonse>` with a second-level `<samlp:StatusCode>` of
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:NoPassive` in response to any
`<samlp:AuthnRequest>` with an `IsPassive` attribute value of `true` or `1`.

*[CDP-IDP05]*

IdPs participating as a session authority MUST include the `SessionIndex`
attribute of `<saml:AuthnStatement>`.

*[CDP-IDP06]*

Once an IdP participating as a session authority has issued the first
`<saml:AuthnStatement>` containing the `SessionIndex` for a new session, it MUST
retain sufficient session state to successfully process `<samlp:LogoutRequest>`
messages that specify a matching `<samlp:SessionIndex>` value for no less than 8
hours.

_This ensures that the IdP will be able to propagate single-logout of a
subject's session for up to 8 hours after issuing the first assertion for that
session._

The IdP MAY retain this session state for longer than 8 hours.

The IdP MAY discard all state associated with a `SessionIndex` after processing
a `<samlp:LogoutRequest>` for the session.

*[CDP-IDP07]*

IdPs participating as a session authority MUST administratively perform a global
logout of any current subject's session whenever an authentication event within
that session results in the authentication of a different subject.

_For example, say the IdP has issued the first `<saml:AuthnStatement>` for
subject A within the last 8 hours, and subsequently receives a
`<samlp:AuthnRequest>` from the same user agent triggering a new authentication
event. If the end-user authenticates with a different credential (subject B)
than the one originally used by subject A, then the IdP must peform a global
logout of subject A's session, before starting a new session for subject B._

==== Security

*[CDP-IDP08]*

The private keys of an IdPs signing certificates MUST be protected within the
boundary of a FIPS 140-2 Level 2 or higher validated hardware cryptographic
module.

==== Attributes

*[CDP-IDP09]*
Identity Provider deployments MUST be capable of determining whether or not to
include specific SAML attributes (or specific values) in a response based on the
presence of `<md:AttributeConsumingService>` elements (containing
`<md:RequestedAttribute>` elements) found in the metadata for a relying party,
including the value of the enclosed `isRequired` XML attribute. Accordingly,
they MUST support the `AttributeConsumingServiceIndex` attribute in
`<samlp:AuthnRequest>`` messages as a means of determining the appropriate
`<md:AttributeConsumingService>` element to process.


*[CDP-IDP10]*

IdP deployments SHOULD prioritize the use of standard attribute
name and definition profiles before defining custom attributes. Use of the
following profiles are RECCOMENDED in descending order of preference:

* The standard OpenID Connect claims defined in section 5.1 of <<OIDC>>. (See
  *[CDP-IDP12]* below). 
* The Identity Metasystem Interoperability claim types
  defined in section 7.5 of <<IMI>>.
* The SAML V2.0 X.500/LDAP Attribute Profile <<X500SAMLattr>>.

*[CDP-IDP11]*

<saml:Attribute> elements MUST use a `NameFormat` value of either
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:basic` or
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri`.

*[CDP-IDP12]*

The name and value of  `<saml:Attribute>` elements with a `NameFormat` of
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:basic` MUST correspond to one of
the standard claims defined in section 5.1 of <<OIDC>> as follows:

* The value of the `Name` attribute of `<saml:Attribute>` must match the JSON
 member name in <<OIDC>>.
* The `xsi:type` attribute of `<saml:AttributeValue>` must specify the XML
 Schema type that corresponds to the JSON type in <<OIDC>>:

[width="40%", align="center", options="header"]
|===========================
|JSON Type |XML Schema Type
|string    |xs:string
|boolean   |xs:boolean
|number    |xs:decimal
|===========================

* The `address` claim MUST NOT be used. _Refer to requirement *[SDP-IDP18]*._
* The following properties of the `address` claim MAY be used as standalone
 attributes:
** street_address
** locality
** region
** postal_code
** country
* The `formatted` member of the `address` claim SHOULD NOT be used.
