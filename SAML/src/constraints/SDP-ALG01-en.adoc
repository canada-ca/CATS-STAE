IdP deployments MUST also support the use of
`http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#aes128-cbc` <<XMLEnc>> to encrypt Assertions
for any SP that has specified this algorithm in its metadata.

The use of block encryption algorithms using the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) mode
of option is RECCOMMENDED for SP deployments, however
`http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#aes128-cbc` MAY be used if the SP software
does not support GCM algorithms.

_As per <<ITSP.40.111>>, these encryption and signature algorithms are approved
for use to protect the confidentiality of PROTECTED A and PROTECTED B
information and the integrity of information to the medium injury level._

Deployments MUST configure TLS according to <<ITSP.40.062>> and <<ITPIN-2018-01>>.
