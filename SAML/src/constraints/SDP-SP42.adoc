The metadata of SPs MUST contain at least one signing certificate with
the ``use`` attribute set to ``signing`` and at least one encryption certificate
with the ``use`` attribute set to ``encryption``.

An `<md:Extensions>` element MAY contain an `<mdui:UIInfo>` but MUST NOT include
an `<mdattr:EntityAttributes>` attribute.

The ``<md:SPSSODescriptor>`` element of an SP's metadata MUST also include an
``AuthnRequestsSigned`` attribute set to ``true`` or ``1`` and a
``WantAssertionsSigned`` attribute set to ``true`` or ``1``.

An SP's metadata SHOULD include two `<md:SingleLogoutService>` el;ements, one
with the `Binding` attribute value of
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect`, the other with the
`Binding` attribute value of `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:SOAP`.
