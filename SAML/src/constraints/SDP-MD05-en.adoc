Deployments owned by Government of Canada departments and agencies MUST use
X.509 certificates issued by the Government Shared Services (GSS) Certificate
Authority for signing and encryption of SAML messages.

X.509 certificates used for TLS server authentication MUST be issued by a
certificate authority that is recognized by all of the following:

* https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/ca_program.html[The Apple Trusted Root Certificate Program]
* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/javasecarootcertsprogram-1876540.html[The Java Trusted Root Certificate Program]
* https://technet.microsoft.com/en-ca/library/cc751157.aspx[The Microsoft Trusted Root Certificate Program]
* https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA[The Mozilla Trusted Root Certificate Program]

Deployments MUST NOT accept expired certificates.

Deployments SHOULD NOT perform runtime path validation or revocation checking of
X.509 certificates used for signing or encryption of SAML messages.

_Using revocation checking mechanisms such as certificate revocation lists
(CRLs) and the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) during runtime creates
a dependency that can reduce the availability of a deployment. In the event of a
private key compromise, the Sign in Canada Federation Operator will revoke the
affected deployment's SAML metadata._

Deployments MUST perform path validation and check the revocation status of
X.509 certificates used for TLS server authentication.

_This profile does not contain any requirement for using TLS client
authentication._
