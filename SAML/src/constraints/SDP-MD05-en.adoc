X.509 certificates used for TLS server authentication MUST be issued by a
certificate authority that is recognized by all of the following:

* https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/ca_program.html[The Apple Trusted Root Certificate Program]
* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/javasecarootcertsprogram-1876540.html[The Java Trusted Root Certificate Program]
* https://technet.microsoft.com/en-ca/library/cc751157.aspx[The Microsoft Trusted Root Certificate Program]
* https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA[The Mozilla Trusted Root Certificate Program]

X.509 certificates used for TLS server authentication MUST comply with the
following:

* https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT205280[Apple's Certificate Transparency policy]
* https://github.com/chromium/ct-policy[Chromium Certificate Transparency Policy]

Deployments MUST NOT accept expired certificates.

Deployments SHOULD NOT perform runtime path validation or revocation checking of
X.509 certificates used for signing or encryption of SAML messages.

_Using revocation checking mechanisms such as certificate revocation lists
(CRLs) and the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) during runtime creates
a dependency that can reduce the availability of a deployment. In the event of a
private key compromise, the Sign in Canada Federation Operator will revoke the
affected deployment's SAML metadata._

Deployments MUST perform path validation and check the revocation status of
X.509 certificates used for TLS server authentication.

_This profile does not contain any requirement for using TLS client
authentication._
