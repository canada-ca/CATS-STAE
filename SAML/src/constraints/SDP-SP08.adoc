SP deployments participating in the Sign in Canada federation MUST include
`<samlp:RequestedAuthnContext>` with the `Comparison` attribute set to `exact`.

The `<samlp:RequestedAuthnContext>` MUST include a Level of Assurance as specified in
<<SAML2Assur>>.

The SP MAY request more than one level of assurance in descending priority
order.

_This is useful when a certain minumum level of assurance is required, but the
SP is willing to accept a higher level of assurance._

_The AuthnContext Schema for the Sign in Canada levels of assurance are
published at https://github.com/canada-ca/CATS-STAE/tree/master/SAML/src/schemas._
