`<samlp:NameIDPolicy>` MAY contain a `Format` attribute, in which case its value
MUST be `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent`.

An `SPNameQualifier` attribute MAY also be present to request that the assertion
subject's identifier be returned (or created) in the namespace of a service
provider other than the requester, or in the namespace of an affiliation group
of service providers.

_``SPNameQualifier`` provides critical functionality that supports changes in
the topology of a federation. This is why this profile has not adopted
<<SAML2SubjAttr>> as it does not currently provide equivalent functionality._
