`<samlp:NameIDPolicy>` MAY contain a `Format` attribute, in which case its value
MUST be `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent`.

`<SPNameQualifier>` MAY also be present to indicate:

.. the SP's membership in an affiliation of SPs, or
.. the SP's desire to request a persistent `<NameID>` value assigned to an
entityID previously used by the same SP, or
.. a Proxying Identity Provider's desire to request a persistent `<NameID>`
value on behalf of one of its client SPs.

_``<SPNameQualifier>`` provides critical functionality that supports changes in
the topology of a federation. This is why this profile has not adopted
<<SAML2SubjAttr>> as it does not currently provide equivalent functionality._
