SP deployments MUST include `<samlp:RequestedAuthnContext>`. The optional
`Comparison` attribute MAY be included, in which case it MUST have the value
`exact`.

The `<samlp:RequestedAuthnContext>` MUST include a Level of Assurance as
specified in <<SAML2Assur>>.

The SP MAY indicate a willingness to accept more than one level of assurance, by
including multiple `<saml:AuthnContextClassRef>` elements.

_This is useful when a certain minimum level of assurance is required, but the
SP is willing to accept a higher level of assurance._
